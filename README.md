# My Links Hub 🌐

This is a simple web application that serves as a central hub for all my important links and projects. Instead of constantly updating my resume or relying on free servers that may expire, I decided to use GitHub.io to host this page. It's fast, free, and easy to update!

## Why This Exists 💡

Instead of updating my resume every time I have a new project or link, I created this page as a central hub. It's a quick and efficient way to share my work without worrying about broken links or expired free servers. Plus, it's hosted on GitHub.io, so it's always up-to-date!
